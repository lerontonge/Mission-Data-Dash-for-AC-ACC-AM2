# Mission-Data-Dash-for-AC-ACC-AM2

A simhub dashboard for  Assetto Corsa,  Assetto Corsa Competizione, Automobilista 2, and more

While browsing on Race Department [I found this dashboard](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/mission-data-display-unit.66416/), it was made for iRacing so it didn't have full functionality for the sims I play. So I did what any sane sim racer would do who also had some coding ability. I took it and made it my "own". All credit goes to [sixaxis](https://www.racedepartment.com/members/sixaxis.244073/) for the beautiful UI design of this dashboard. I could never. I'm a coder, not a designer.

Upon closer inspection, you will see that my implementation of this dashboard is a little different from the original. This one is tweaked as per my requirements, for the sims that I race. I also added a few UI tweaks here and there while keeping with the original theme of the Dash.
